# YouTube Hide Control On Pause (YT HideControlOnPause) - Chrome Plugin

## What it does 🤔
With this plugin, when a video is paused, YouTube's player controls and dark gradient overlay appear only on hover — just as they do during playback.

## Why it exists 🧐
When you are watching a tutorial on YouTube, sometimes you want to pause the video, take a quick screenshot, and keep it in your note-taking app. But the controls and the dark gradient overlay at the bottom is not letting you take a clean screenshot. 😖 😢

Say goodbye to that frustration! This plugin will hide the controls and the dark gradient overlay during pause - just like it is during playback. 😊 ✨

## Note
- Works only on YouTube video pages.
- No options or permissions required.
