# YouTube Hide Control On Pause (Chrome Plugin)

## What it does

This plugin hides the YouTube player's control and the dark gradient overlay when the video is paused and makes them appear only on mouse hover â€” just as they do during playback.

No settings to waste time around and no hotkey to remember. Simply install and forget about it.

## Why it exists

When you are watching a tutorial on YouTube, sometimes you want to pause the video, take a quick screenshot, and keep it in your note-taking app. But the control and the dark gradient overlay are not letting you take a clean screenshot. ðŸ˜¤ ðŸ˜¢

When you are watching something beautiful on Youtube, sometimes you want to pause the video and admire what you are seeing. But the control and the dark gradient overlay are obscuring the beauty you want to admire. ðŸ˜ž ðŸ˜¢

Say goodbye to that frustration! This plugin will hide that obtrusive control and the dark gradient overlay during pause - just like it is during playback. ðŸ˜Š âœ¨
