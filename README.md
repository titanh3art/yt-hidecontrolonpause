# YT HideControlOnPause [YouTube Hide Control On Pause] (Chrome Plugin)

## What it does
This plugin hides the YouTube player's controls and the dark gradient overlay when the video is paused and makes them appear only on mouse hover — just as they do during playback.

## Why it exists
When you are watching a tutorial on YouTube, sometimes you want to pause the video, take a quick screenshot, and keep it in your note-taking app. But the controls and the dark gradient overlay are not letting you take a clean screenshot. 😤 😢

And when you are watching something beautiful on Youtube, sometimes you want to pause the video and admire what you are seeing. But the controls and the dark gradient overlay are obscuring the beauty you want to admire. 😞 😢

Say goodbye to that frustration! This plugin will hide that obtrusive controls and the dark gradient overlay during pause - just like it is during playback. 😊 ✨

## Note
- Works only on YouTube video pages.
- No options or permissions required.
